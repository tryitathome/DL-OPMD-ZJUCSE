# YOLO12-Multi-classification-Oral-Mucosal-Diseases

这个项目是基于Ultralytics YOLOv12框架开发的目标检测解决方案，主要用于牙科图像中的口腔病变检测。系统支持训练、测试、推理和结果可视化等功能。
This project is an object detection solution based on the Ultralytics YOLOv12 framework, primarily designed for detecting oral lesions in dental images. The system supports training, testing, inference, and result visualization functionalities.


# Binary_Classification-Oral_Mucosal_Diseases 

该项目实现了一个用于口腔疾病图像分类的深度学习系统，支持多种现代化的深度神经网络架构，包括Swin Transformer、ConvNeXT、MetaFormer等。项目具有完整的训练、验证、测试和预测流程，适用于医学图像（尤其是口腔图像）的分类任务。本项目主要专注于口腔潜在恶性疾病(OPMD)与口腔良性疾病的二分类任务。
This project implements a deep learning system for oral disease image classification, supporting various modern deep neural network architectures including Swin Transformer, ConvNeXT, MetaFormer, etc. The project features complete training, validation, testing, and prediction workflows suitable for medical image classification tasks, particularly for oral images. The primary focus of this project is binary classification of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD) versus benign oral diseases.
